        <h1>Arul's Hobbies</h1>
        <p>
            My personal development and daily life are significantly shaped by a consistent
            engagement in several key hobbies: fitness training at the gym, swimming, video
            gaming, and reading. Each activity contributes distinctly to my physical and
            mental well-being, fostering discipline, strategic thinking, and continuous learning.
        </p>

        <p>
            My commitment to fitness commenced two and a half years ago. This period marked a
            dedicated involvement in gym-based strength training. While a recent knee injury
            temporarily impacted my ability to perform exercises such as deadlifts and squats,
            I have since resumed deadlifting. A current personal best in the bench press is 245
            pounds, indicative of consistent training effort.
        </p>

        <p>
            Swimming has recently been integrated into my routine, primarily to support current
            weight management goals. This re-engagement follows a substantial prior history with
            the sport, having competed in high school and begun training at the age of five. This
            background provides a foundation for the current application of swimming as a complementary
            physical activity.
        </p>

        <p>
            My engagement with video games includes Pokemon Legends: Arceus and Mario Kart 8. In Pokemon
            Legends: Arceus, my primary objective is the comprehensive completion of the Pokédex prior to
            progressing to the game's final stages. The game's open-world design and 3D Pokémon models
            are notable features that enhance this experience. Mario Kart 8 presents a different kind of
            challenge, focusing on the mastery of complex in-game shortcuts. The process involves
            identifying these shortcuts, extensive practice, and their subsequent successful implementation
            during competitive races.
        </p>

        <p>
            Reading serves as a consistent activity providing mental engagement, with a current focus on
            The Art of War. This hobby facilitates exposure to diverse narratives and informational content,
            contributing to a broader understanding and continuous intellectual development.
        </p>

        <p>
            Collectively, these hobbies represent a structured approach to personal enrichment. They provide
            avenues for physical exertion, strategic problem-solving, and intellectual growth, forming an
            integral part of my daily existence and ongoing self-improvement.
