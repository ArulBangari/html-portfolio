        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <img src="../assets/images/Arul.jpg" height="100" class="arul"/>
        <p>
        Hey there! I'm Arul, a recent UCSC grad with a unique blend of skills
        thanks to my double major in Computer Science and Business Management Economics.
        </p>

        <p>
        My journey started at Carlmont High School, where I was always on the
        move, whether it was in the pool for swimming, on the court for basketball,
        or hitting the trails for cross country. That active spirit carried into college,
        and by my junior year, I really dove into going to the gym, making it a daily part of my
        routine. Even now, in my free time, I love to go to the gym and get in some swimming.
        </p>

        <p>
        Now that I've wrapped up my studies at UCSC, I'm excited to jump into the professional
        world and find a job where I can make an impact. When I'm not on the job hunt, you'll
        find me building applications that spark my curiosity and are just plain fun to create.
