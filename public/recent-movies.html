<hr />
<h3>Final Destination 5</h3>
<p>It was a pretty gory movie. The deaths were very cringe inducing. Would not watch again, got bored and didn't really like the deaths as much</p>
<h3>Mufasa: The Lion King</h3>
<p>Liked this movie. Went into the background of how Mufasa became king and how Scar tried to betray him. Would watch again</p>
<h3>The Shining</h3>
<p>Good movie</p>
